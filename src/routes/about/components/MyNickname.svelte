  A little history about my nickname <span class="text-[#5862F2]">LWJerri</span>. It was in 2016, I had a weak computer
  at the time and I always logged into the game Minecraft, but that day I decided to install the latest version of the
  game, after which it crashed because of an error in the library LWJGL. I sat for a long time, looking at this error
  and for some reason decided to perpetuate it by taking the first three letters from that library -
  <span class="text-[#5862F2]">LWJ</span>. This was not enough, the nickname came out too short and not unique, so I
  remembered my favorite cartoon Tom and Jerry and my most favorite character from this cartoon - little mouse Jerry ðŸ¥°.
  In those years my English was not very good and I made a mistake by writing
  <span class="text-[#5862F2]">Jerri</span> instead of Jerry to the prefix "LWJ". That's how the unique nickname LWJerri
  came about.
