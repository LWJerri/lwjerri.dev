  I spend all my free time at my laptop because my hobby is the same as my main occupation - programming. Sometimes I watch
  informative videos about life, about handcrafts or explaining some things in life. I also listen to a lot of music, and
  learn English and Czech, to be able to express my emotions without any restrictions. I love nature, traveling with people
  close to me, I love atmospheric places and moments in my life. I also love to eat, so being able to cook is very important
  to me, even though I'm not really into it.
